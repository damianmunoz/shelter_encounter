Shelter Encounter -> 

Shelter Encounter is a top-down 2D survival zombie game developed as a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). The game focuses on delivering an immersive survival experience with straightforward gameplay mechanics and visually appealing assets. This project is designed to showcase the potential of the concept while serving as a foundation for future expansions.

OVERVIEW

In Shelter Encounter, players must survive in a confined environment overrun by zombies. Armed with various weapons and combat techniques, you must navigate through a house while fending off a single enemy type: zombies. Inspired by retro-styled games with a modern design philosophy, the game leverages the power of the Flame game engine to create an engaging and visually dynamic experience.

Survival Gameplay: Fight off relentless zombie attacks while navigating the house.

- Player Combat Options: Access to multiple weapons and combat styles:
